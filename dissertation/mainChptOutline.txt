main chapter outline

Abstraction
1. Problem Statement
2. Abstraction Setup and Modelling (Proofs go here?)
3. Setup as GB calc, prove always ok, show slow results
 3.1 Show setup with F2^m -> F2^n
4. One spoly reduction setup (DO WE HAVE ANY PROOFS HERE?)
 4.1 Show equivalence to Reduction of Output Poly
5. Experimental Results, show with bug and without.
6. Conclusions

Using Abstraction in Verifiations
1. Problem Statement
2. Verification Setup using Jinpeng's approach
3. Experimental results
4. Conclusions

Conclusions and Future work
