%%% -*-LaTeX-*-
%%% ====================================================================
%%% This is a sample top-level LaTeX-2e file for typesetting a thesis
%%% or dissertation at the University of Utah.  Most students find it
%%% convenient to start with a COPY of this file as a template, and
%%% then alter that copy to match their needs.
%%%
%%% There is an associated Unix Makefile that can be similarly
%%% customized, and then the only command ever needed to typeset the
%%% complete thesis is the single word "make".  Of course, during
%%% writing and typesetting, not all of the steps are needed, so
%%% often, one can just name a convenience target such as "make
%%% dvi-pass" or "make pdf-pass" to do just a single pass of LaTeX and
%%% BibTeX.
%%%
%%% There should be no, or very few, macro definitions in this file;
%%% any needed belong in a private style file, called mythesis.sty,
%%% and input below after all other packages.  The bulk of this file
%%% should just be command invocations, and any arguments that they
%%% need.
%%%
%%% We exploit the fact that TeX ignores spaces after command names to
%%% line up arguments for better readability.
%%%
%%% Each chapter should be a separate complete file, so that you can
%%% insert a command like \includeonly{chap_intro} before the first
%%% \include{chap_xxx} command to avoid typesetting all but the
%%% chapter that you are currently working on, to save time.
%%%
%%% Remember that occupants of job positions change jobs from time to
%%% time: YOU are responsible for ensuring correct names of all humans
%%% mentioned in this file!

%%% ====================================================================
%%% The various uuthesis-*.sty packages must come AFTER all other
%%% system-provided packages, so that they can correctly override
%%% settings from those packages.

%%% Include latest updates for 2016 (WARNING: the name is subject to
%%% change: see http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/uuthesis/ for the most
%%% current version.)

\usepackage {uuthesis-2016-h}  % MANDATORY package

%%% This is an OPTIONAL package that sets chapter and sectional headings
%%% in color:
%%% Use one or the other of these:
% \usepackage {color}
%%: \usepackage {uuthesis-color-headings}
%%: \definecolor{utahheadingcolor} {rgb}  {0.7, 0.0, 0.0}
%%: \definecolor{utahtheoremcolor} {rgb}  {0.490,0.149,0.804} % purple4
%%: \definecolor{utahtheoremcolor} {rgb}  {0.545,0.137,0.137} % brown4

%%% Here is another, and more convenient, way to define colors, via
%%% aliases of named colors in the X11-derived rgb.sty file

%%: \usepackage{coloralias}
%%: \definecoloralias{utahheadingcolor}{steelblue4}
%%: \definecoloralias{utahtheoremcolor}{hotpink3}

%%% The default heading color is utahred (defined by University Printing
%%% Services as 0.8 red, 0.0 green, 0.0 blue), but you could redefine
%%% that to, for example, a dark blue color, like this AFTER including
%%% the package:
%%%
%%%     \definecolor{utahheading}{rgb}{0,0,0.8}
%%%
%%% NB: Be careful with use of colors in typesetting, and in figures,
%%% because about 6 percent of the human male population is red/green
%%% color blind: they see those colors as shades of brown.  Red and
%%% blue, or blue and green, are better choices for choosing
%%% distinguishable colors.  Also, avoid light colors, especially
%%% yellow, because they are hard to see against white paper and
%%% screen backgrounds, and when printed on black-and-white printers,
%%% where they are rendered in gray, they may be too faint to read.

%%% This single user-specific file is where all personal customizations
%%% and macro definitions should be placed, and it should come LAST,
%%% after ALL OTHER packages, in case it needs to override some of their

\thesistype             {dissertation}

\dedication             {For my parents and Huizhong.}

%%% Most students need just a short degree name, like this:
\degree                 {Doctor of Philosophy}
%%% However, multiline degrees are possible, and are done like this:
%%% \degree                 {Doctor of Philosophy \\
%%%                         in \\
%%%                         Mathematical Physics}

%%% NB: It is rare, but possible, for there to be two chairs, For

%%%
%%% \committeechair{\mbox{\small Andrej Cherkaev and Andrejs Treibergs}}
%%%
%%% The \mbox{} ensures that line breaks cannot happen, and the \small
%%% is necessary to make the names fit on the Dissertation Approval form

%%% The choice of bibliography style is a major decision, jointly made
%%% by you, your thesis advisor and the thesis editor. Common choices are
%%% one of the four standard BibTeX styles (abbrv, alpha, plain, and unsrt),
%%% or enhanced styles like acm, amsplain, siam, and hundreds of others
%%% available in TeX Live, and other Unix and Windows TeX distributions.
%%%
%%% Do NOT handcode your reference list, because you are unlikely to
%%% achieve consistency or conformance to the University of Utah Thesis Office
%%% requirements: let BibTeX do that tedious job for you!
%%%
%%% Remember that reference-list metadata in BibTeX files remains
%%% constant across journals and publishers, and is are often reused
%%% in other documents and shared with others, whereas formatted
%%% reference-list styles change: with BibTeX, you only need to record
%%% the metadata once.
%%%
%%% If you prefer named, rather than numeric or tagged citations, you
%%% may use styles such as authordate{1,2,3,4}, chicago, harvard, or
%%% natbib.  Be aware, however, that most of those require an
%%% additional \usepackage{} command to supply \LaTeX{} with
%%% definitions of commands that the style needs, and that there are
%%% usually several flavors of LaTeX citation commands beyond the
%%% standard \cite{} command that you need to understand before you
%%% can use them properly in your prose.

%%% This tells BibTeX to read siam.bst from the first directory where
%%% it is found in the BSTINPUTS search path:

% \bibliographystyle{siam}

%%% This can also specify a comma-separated list (without embedded
%%% spaces) of *.bib files found by BibTeX in its BIBINPUTS search
%%% path.  The argument \jobname means the base name of the top-level
%%% LaTeX file, avoiding an unnecessary filename dependence here.
%%%
%%% BibTeX writes only one .bbl file, no matter how many *.bib files
%%% are listed here, using the name \jobname.bbl.
%%%
%%% LaTeX reads BibTeX's formatted reference list from the file
%%% \jobname.bbl.

% \bibliography{\jobname}
