Show that only one valid spoly exists. LT must have common variable. Jinpeng's
vanishing polys

Show One spoly.
Show that reduce this spoly = reduce word-level.
Prove that reduce word-level = input bit level + word level output.
Show that in the case of bug-free -> Word-level only!

Show that regardless of representation, abstraction approach is applicable to
Jinpeng's approach and can be used in equivalence checking.
