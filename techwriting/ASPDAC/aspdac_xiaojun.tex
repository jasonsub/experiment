{\small\textbf{Abstract---
Sequential circuits that implement arithmetic over Galois fields
$\Fkk$ are prevalent in cryptography and error control coding, where
the datapath size $k$ is very large. Formal verification of sequential
arithmetic circuits with large datapath size is beyond the
capabilities of contemporary verification techniques. To address this
problem, this paper describes a verification method based on algebraic
geometry that: i) implicitly unrolls the sequential arithmetic circuit
over multiple clock-cycles; and ii) represents the function
computed by the state-registers of the circuit, canonically, as a
multi-variate word-level polynomial over $\Fkk$. Our approach employs
the Groebner basis algorithm, along with a specific elimination ideal,
to identify the $k$-cycle computation performed  by the circuit. We
demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by verifying up to 89-bit
sequential Galois field multipliers, whereas conventional techniques
fail beyond 23-bit circuits. 
%% Sequential circuits that implement Galois field arithmetic over
%% $\Fkk$ are prevalent in cryptography and error control coding, where
%% the datapath size $k$ is very large. Formal verification of sequential
%% arithmetic circuits with large datapath size is beyond the
%% capabilities of contemporary verification techniques. To address this
%% problem, this paper introduces a new concept of implicit state
%% enumeration of finite state machines (FSMs) performed at the
%% word-level. Using algebraic geometry, we show that the state-space of
%% a sequential circuit can be encoded, canonically, as solutions to a
%% multivariate word-level polynomial $\F(A)$ in $\Fkk$, where $A = {a_0,
%% \dots, a_{k-1}}$ represents the $k$-bit state-register (word). Subsequently,
%% the Groebner basis algorithm, along with elimination ideals and quotients 
%% of ideals can be employed for FSM traversal. We apply our approach 
%% to verify sequential Galois field multipliers with large datapath sizes, 
%% where contemporary techniques prove to be infeasible.
