\title{Proposal: Reachability and Liveness for Marked Graph based on Invariants}
\author{Xiaojun Sun}
\maketitle

\section{Objective}
Reachability can not easily be checked through simple traversals, because a Labeled Petri-Net can have distint
markings even a fixed point was reached, \textit{i.e.} a reachable state set may have infinite number of markings
. However a necassary condition is found, which means it can also be deployed as a sufficient consition to
find all unreachable states. That is
One kind of constrained Petri-Nets is Marked Graph

\section{Techniques}
In Galois field $F_{2^k}$, when k is large, symbolic BDD-based methods are infeasible.
The essence of the new technique is state-space traversal using algebraic geometry. In the traversal
algorithm, concepts such as \emph{states'} \emph{Union, Intersection} and \emph{Complementary set} are modeled
in a computer algebra/Gr\"obner basis framework. Each state
can be represented with a polynomial ideal, and the values of labels are mapped to the variants of their
ideals. Based on this refined state-space traversal, the \emph{next state} in every iteration can be 
calculated in the form of a polynomial ideal, which is compared to the desired function for eqivalence 
checking.

\section{Challenges}
(a)\ \ Derive appropriate verification formulation using algebraic geometry; \\
\indent \hspace{5mm} \ \\
(b)\ \ Solve the system using Gr\"obner basis while addressing the issue of scalability of the Gr\"obner basis algorithm; \\
\indent \hspace{5mm} \ \\
(c)\ \ In [1], standard basis representation is an appropriate tool for interpretation of combinational
arithmetic circuits. For sequential circuits, normal basis representation has unique advantages, 
but normal basis theory and algorithms are not well developed. These symbolic computation algorithms will
also have to be explored in this work.
