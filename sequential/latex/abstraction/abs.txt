A combinational circuit with k-inputs and k-outputs implements a
Boolean function f:B^k ---> B^k, where B = {0, 1\}. The same function
can also be construed as a mapping f: F_{2^k} ---> F_{2^k},  where
F_{2^k} denotes a Galois field of 2^k elements. Every function over
F_{2^k} is a polynomial function -- i.e. there exists a unique,
minimal, canonical polynomial F that describes f. This paper describes
a method to derive this canonical (word-level) polynomial
representation for the circuit as Y = F(A) over F_{2^k}, such that A
is the input bit-vector and Y the output. We show that this can be
achieved by computing a Groebner basis of a set of polynomials derived 
from the circuit, using an elimination term  order. Computing a
Groebner basis using elimination orders is, however, practically
infeasible for large circuits. We subsequently show that a large
circuit can be partitioned into sub-circuits with arbitrary
input-output bit-widths and polynomials can be derived for these
sub-circuits over f: F_{2^n} ---> F_{2^m}. Finally, a hierarchical
approach is proposed for polynomial interpolation from circuits. We
demonstrate the application of our approach to verification of
Galois-field multiplier circuits, which are generally hard to verify
using contemporary automatic verification tools.
