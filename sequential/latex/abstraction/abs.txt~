A combinational circuit with $k$-inputs and $k$-outputs implements a
Boolean function $f: \B^k \rightarrow \B^k$, where $\B = \{0, 1\}$.
The same function can also be construed as a mapping $f: \Fkk
\rightarrow \Fkk$,  where $\Fkk$ denotes a Galois field of $2^k$
elements. Every function over $\Fkk$ is a polynomial function ---
i.e. there exists a unique, minimal, canonical polynomial
$\F$ that describes $f$. This paper describes a method to derive the
canonical (word-level) polynomial representation for the circuit $Y =
\F (A)$ over $\Fkk$, such that $A$ is the input bit-vector and $Y$ the
output. We show that this can be achieved by computing a Gr\"obner
basis of a set of polynomials derived from the circuit, using an
elimination term  order. Computing a Gr\"obner basis using elimination
orders is, however, practically infeasible for large circuits. We
subsequently show that a large circuit can be partitioned into
sub-circuits with arbitrary input-output bit-widths and polynomials
can be derived for these sub-circuits over $f: {\mathbb{F}}_{2^n}
\rightarrow {\mathbb{F}}_{2^m}$. Finally, a hierarchical approach is
proposed for polynomial interpolation from circuits. We demonstrate
the application of our approach to verification of Galois-field
multiplier circuits, which are generally hard to verify using
contemporary automatic verification tools.
